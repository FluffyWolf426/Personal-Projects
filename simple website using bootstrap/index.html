                            these beloved animals have found their way onto the country's coins. From the iconic
                            kangaroo to the lesser-known numbat, Australian coins feature a wide range of native
                            animals, making them not just currency but also a showcase of the country's unique flora and
                            fauna. Each animal has its own story and symbolism, with many representing the country's
                            spirit and identity. In this section, we'll explore some of the animals that have appeared

                                Echidnas are one of the most unique animals found in Australia. They are one of only two
                                egg-laying mammals in the world, the other being the platypus. Echidnas are also known
                                as
                                spiny anteaters because of the spines that cover their backs. These spines act as a
                                defense
                                mechanism, and echidnas can curl up into a ball to protect themselves from predators.
                                They
                                use their long snouts to find ants, termites, and other insects to eat, and their sticky
                                tongues can dart in and out up to 100 times per minute. Echidnas are also excellent
                                diggers
                                and can dig themselves a burrow in just a few hours.

                                Lyrebirds are known for their incredible mimicry skills. They can imitate a wide range
                                of
                                sounds, including other bird calls, human speech, and even the sound of cameras or
                                chainsaws. Male lyrebirds are also known for their impressive courtship displays, where
                                they
                                spread their tail feathers into a lyre shape and dance around their territory to attract
                                a
                                mate. Female lyrebirds are responsible for raising their young, which they do alone. The
                                chicks hatch from eggs and stay in the nest for several months before leaving and
                                becoming
                                independent.

                                Platypuses are another unique Australian animal. They are one of only two egg-laying
                                mammals
                                in the world and have a duck-like bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail. They use
                                their
                                bill to find small aquatic animals to eat, such as insects, crustaceans, and small fish.
                                Male platypuses have venomous spurs on their hind legs, which they use to fight with
                                other
                                males during breeding season. Platypuses are also excellent swimmers and can close their
                                ears and nostrils to dive underwater for several minutes.

                                Emus are the second-largest bird in the world after the ostrich and are native to
                                Australia.
                                They have powerful legs and can run at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Emus are also
                                great swimmers and can cross rivers and lakes. Female emus lay large green eggs that
                                weigh
                                up to 1 pound each, and males are responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the
                                chicks. Emus are omnivorous and eat a variety of plants and animals, including insects,
                                fruits, and small vertebrates. They have been known to travel long distances in search

                                food and water during times of drought.

                                Kangaroos are marsupials found only in Australia. They are known for their powerful
                                hind
                                legs and their ability to hop, which allows them to move quickly and efficiently
                                across
                                the open plains of Australia. Some species of kangaroos can jump up to three times
                                their
                                own body length. Kangaroos are herbivores and eat a variety of plants, including
                                grasses, leaves, and fruits. Baby kangaroos, called joeys, are born after only 33-38
                                days of gestation and are born very small and undeveloped. They immediately crawl
                                into
                                their mother's pouch, where they continue to develop for several months before
                                becoming
                                fully independent. Kangaroos are also known for their unique reproductive system,
                                where
                                females can have two different embryos at different stages of development.
